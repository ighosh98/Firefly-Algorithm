## Summary
- The PSO algorithm is an adapted and modified version of the open source library pySwarm as the paper does not detail the methods used to implement a PSO.
- The code is divided into two files[`firefly.py`(Firefly Algorithm) and `PSOAlgorithm.py`(PSO Algorithm)]. You can run the code for corresponding algorithms.
